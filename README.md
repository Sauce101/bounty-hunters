In this project I use React.js in conjunction with Tailwind CSS. I use a Star Wars type of feel just for getting ideas on how to mix patterns and thoughts that come to mind. I chose The Empire Strikes Back bountyhunters as a way to showcase some of the ways to mix Tailwind and React Router Dom. I also use ESLint with the airbnb config along with Prettier code formatter. Also with Husky to run lint-staged befor GitHub commit. [Visit Site](https://bountyhunters.netlify.app/)
