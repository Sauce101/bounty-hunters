Tailwind CSS project with React Progressive Web App. I also use ESLint with the Airbnb config along with Prettier code formatter. Also with Husky to run lint-staged before GitHub commit. I use a Star Wars type of feel just for getting ideas on how to mix patterns and thoughts that come to mind. I chose The Empire Strikes Back bounty hunters as a way to showcase some of the ways to mix Tailwind and React Router Dom. The models are sixth scale action figures.
