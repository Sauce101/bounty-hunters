          Dengar, also known as Dengar the Demolisher, was a Corellian human
          bounty hunter operating since the early stages of the Clone Wars.
          Dengar participated in an operation on Quarzite—during which he served
          as a member of Krayt&apos;s Claw, a syndicate of hunters including
          Boba Fett, Bossk, and Asajj Ventress—to secure property valuable to
          Lord Otua Blank of the planet Quarzite. Dengar also took jobs for
          clients such as the Grand Hutt Council, fighting against Maul and his
          Shadow Collective on Nal Hutta.

          Dengar remained active through the Galactic Civil War, during which he
          was one of several bounty hunters hired by Darth Vader to capture Han
          Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon. Though Dengar ultimately lost
          Vader&apos;s bounty to his rival and partner Boba Fett, he was later
          present with Bossk and Fett in Jabba&apos;s Palace on Tatooine during
          Solo&apos;s rescue by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker.

          Dengar&apos;s impressive longevity led him to continue his work as a
          bounty hunter even after the Empire was defeated at the Battle of
          Endor. Around a year later, he teamed up with other tenured hunters
          such as Embo when he joined Jas Emari and her crew after the Battle of
          Jakku.
