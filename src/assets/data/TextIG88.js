        IG-88B, pronounced Eyegee-Eightyeight, also commonly known simply as
        IG-88, or as a Phlutdroid, was a rogue, deadly masculine IG-series
        assassin droid manufactured by Holowan Laboratories who worked as a
        bounty hunter. Following the Battle of Hoth, he and several other bounty
        hunters were summoned by Darth Vader to the Executor and hired to track
        down the Millennium Falcon and its Rebel crew. Unable to track his
        quarry, IG-88 trailed his chief rival, Boba Fett, to Bespin, where the
        bounty hunter nearly destroyed the assassin droid; however, IG-88
        managed to survive. At some point IG-88 undertook a software
        infiltration into Death Star II, but his plan was single-handedly
        thwarted by R2-Q5. Decades later, the droid met with mercenary Bazine
        Netal to speak about the location of the Millennium Falcon.

        The IG-88 designated &quot;B&quot; operated as a bounty hunter, with his
        appearances throughout the galaxy serving as cover for their real
        operations on Mechis III. One assignment saw the droid bounty hunter
        hired by Ko Zatec-Cha, vizier of Tammuz-an, to track down the missing
        Prince Mon Julpa. IG-88 tracked Julpa to Tyne&apos;s Horky and followed
        him to see if the lost Prince would lead him to the Tammuz-an Royal
        Scepter. During the course of this assignment, IG-88 would cross paths
        with the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO.

        IG-88B was the second of the four IG-88s. It was agreed by all four of
        the units that this one would be the bounty hunter as to distract any
        attention from Mechis III where the droid revolution was being
        conducted. He flew the first sleek ship of its class: the IG-2000. It
        was this one that was aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor during
        the hunt for Han Solo. While aboard, he learned of the new Death Star
        project underway at the forest moon of Endor. He relayed the information
        to the other three IG-88s. Afterwards, he had IG-88C place trackers on
        all of the bounty hunters&apos; ships that were present and used them to
        find Solo, as he did not want to encounter Fett. Boba Fett was not
        fooled; he allowed IG-88B to follow him to Bespin, where the droid met
        its end. IG-88B was left as scrap in the bowels of Cloud City.
