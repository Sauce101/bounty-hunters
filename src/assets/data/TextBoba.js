        Boba Fett was a human male crime lord and former bounty hunter whose
        career spanned decades, from the fall of the Galactic Republic to the
        end of the rule of the Galactic Empire. Originally code-named Alpha, he
        was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett
        who raised the boy as his son. Boba emulated his father and genetic
        donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal
        starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft
        that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a
        young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy
        during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. He became a legend over the
        course of his career, which included contracts for both the Empire and
        the extensive criminal underworld. After living among the Tusken Raiders
        of Tatooine for a time, he took over as Daimyo of Mos Espa during the
        era of the New Republic.

        Boba was created on the extragalactic planet of Kamino as a result of an
        arrangement between the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus and Jango Fett, a
        Mandalorian foundling who served as the template of the Grand Army of
        the Republic. Unlike the clone troopers grown from Jango&apos;s DNA,
        Jango regarded Boba as his son. During the last days of the Separatist
        Crisis, Boba and Jango retreated to Geonosis where the latter was killed
        in battle by Jedi Master Mace Windu. Orphaned by Jango&apos;s death,
        Boba sought vengeance by attempting to assassinate Windu, although his
        plan proved unsuccessful. After serving time in prison on Coruscant,
        Fett took up his late father&apos;s profession as a bounty hunter,
        working alongside other mercenaries, such as Bossk, Dengar, and Asajj
        Ventress, while also notably apprenticing himself to his father&apos;s
        infamous brief protégée, Cad Bane.

        In the aftermath of the Clone Wars, Fett continued to make a name for
        himself while working for the gangster Jabba Desilijic Tiure as well as
        the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the Galactic Civil War, the bounty
        hunter managed to track down Captain Han Solo to Bespin on a contract
        for the Galactic Empire, before delivering him to Jabba&apos;s Palace on
        Tatooine. During the journey, Fett stopped on the moon of Nar Shaddaa in
        order to make sure Solo would survive his time in carbonite, but he lost
        the smuggler while he was away as part of the return of the Crimson
        Dawn, kicking off a war between bounty hunters for Solo. Ultimately,
        Fett regained Solo and delivered him to the impatient Jabba.

      <p className="text-base font-normal leading-normal mb-4 text-slate-900">
        Fett tried to prevent Solo&apos;s rescue by the Alliance to Restore the
        Republic, only to fall into the Great Pit of Carkoon when the smuggler
        accidentally slammed a pole into the bounty hunter&apos;s jetpack,
        causing it to malfunction. Although Fett survived his ordeal with the
        man-eating sarlacc, his armor was sold to Cobb Vanth by Jawa scavengers.
        Following a time in the company of a Tusken tribe, Fett eventually
        regained his armor by tracking down and confronting the Mandalorian
        warrior Din Djarin on Tython, who took Fett&apos;s armor from Vanth.
        After helping Djarin to rescue the foundling Grogu from the clutches of
        Moff Gideon, the ex-bounty-hunter returned to Tatooine where he killed
        Bib Fortuna and claimed the late Jabba&apos;s throne as Daimyo with
        Fennec Shand by his side. Now the head of his own gotra, Fett intended
        to rule the territories of Mos Espa by winning the people&apos;s
        respect, though he would face several major challenges to his position
        owed to the two-facedness of mayor Mok Shaiz such as the Twins&apos; bid
        for power and the expansion of the Pyke Syndicate&apos;s spice trade.
        Ultimately, though, Fett overcame all obstacles - including a
        confrontation with his old mentor, Cad Bane - and emerged victorious
        with the help of his associates, gaining the appreciation and approval
        of Mos Espa&apos;s denizens.
