        Bossk (whose name meant &quot;devours his prey&quot; in Dosh) was a male
        Trandoshan bounty hunter who was the pilot of the Hound&apos;s Tooth and
        held the title of monarch of the Qotile system. He was also an old enemy
        and rival for Chewbacca and his Human partner Han Solo. He would face
        them several times, and would unsurprisingly be one of the six bounty
        hunters Darth Vader hired to track down and capture the Millennium
        Falcon. He would unknowingly aid in the freeing of hundreds of Wookiee
        slaves on the island world of Lomabu III. He was also a frequent partner
        and foe of both Boba Fett and Zuckuss, both fellow bounty hunters. After
        being repeatedly beaten by Boba Fett, Bossk would eventually boost his
        reputation as a bounty hunter by defeating Fett on Tatooine.

        Bossk had a very controlling attitude with his partner, and eventually
        killing some of his others, and he worked better alone, coming up with
        some very snarky responses for aliens and humans alike who insult him.
        The reason he killed was because Trandoshans believed that there was a
        &quot;Scorekeeper&quot; at the end of an individual&apos;s life, and
        that for each kill they get points depending on how hard they were to
        kill, or how many kills they have themselves. If one were to be captured
        alive, their score would be erased and the Scorekeeper would &quot;turn
        her head away.&quot;
