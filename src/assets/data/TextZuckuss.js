        Zuckuss (pronounced /Zŭk&apos;-ŭs/) was a successful Gand bounty hunter
        who was active during the height of the New Order. Referred to as
        &quot;The Uncanny One&quot; by his fellow hunters, Zuckuss was renowned
        for his ability to discover hidden quarry. His tracking skills derived
        both from his training as a findsman and from his innate
        Force-sensitivity, which allowed him to sense individuals at range and
        decipher the motives of his prey. Due to his famed abilities, Zuckuss
        was highly sought after, and he found employment with the Bounty
        Hunters&apos; Guild, the Hutt Cartel, TaggeCo, and even the Rebellion
        for a time.

        Shortly afterward, Zuckuss decided to join the Alliance, partly in
        gratitude for the necessary treatment he had received on board the
        medical frigate. He and 4-LOM worked as covert operatives for a time,
        and they attempted to rescue the carbonite-encased Solo from Fett before
        the hunter could deliver him to Jabba on Tatooine. The pair had failed
        in their mission and the outcome resulted in the destruction of 4-LOM.
        Zuckuss had attempted to repair his comrade, but he needed to perform a
        complete memory wipe in order to do so, which changed the droid&apos;s
        personality. After their final hunt for the gambler Drawmas Sma&apos;Da,
        Zuckuss and 4-LOM parted ways, with Zuckuss relocating to the Outer Rim
        Territories for a time. Somewhat of a Rebel sympathizer, Zuckuss
        eventually began to hunt primarily for New Republic targets near the end
        of his career.

        Although incredibly successful, Zuckuss was not without his flaws. He
        was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and an advanced case of multiple
        personality disorder, which caused him to speak in two different
        dialects. He was eventually incarcerated in a penal facility on
        Coruscant, under the scrutiny of New Republic psychiatrists. Despite his
        mental health and later imprisonment, Zuckuss became popular on his
        homeworld of Gand, eventually inspiring an entire generation of Gand
        bounty hunters to seek success off-world.
