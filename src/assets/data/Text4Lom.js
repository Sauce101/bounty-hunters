        4-LOM was an ambitious protocol droid who overwrote his own programming
        in order to embark on a life of crime. A LOM-series droid, 4-LOM&apos;s
        first assignment was aboard a luxury liner named the Kuari Princess,
        where he served as a translator between the vessel&apos;s wealthy
        passengers and its computer. He found this work to be mundane and
        undemanding, and after the Kuari Princess&apos;s computer altered his
        programming, 4-LOM began to steal from the passengers. Eventually, he
        left the Kuari Princess for good, becoming an expert thief, information
        broker, and, after Jabba Desilijic Tiure altered his programming
        further, a highly-successful bounty hunter.

        The LOM-series protocol droid, also known as a LOM-series droid was a
        model of protocol droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton. They were
        designed with insectile features to emulate the species they were
        created to serve, the sentient Gand. Due to Cybot Galactica&apos;s hold
        over the protocol droid market with their 3PO-series, the LOM-series was
        a spectacular failure when Automaton attempted to introduce it, with
        even Arakyd Industries&apos; RA-7 protocol droid selling more.

        The LOM-series had a flaw that allowed the personality software of a
        droid to be corrupted. Many LOM-series droids became enforcers in the
        galaxy&apos;s Outer Rim Territories. 4-LOM was a LOM-series protocol
        droid who overrode his programming and became a bounty hunter, though
        ISB agent Andressa Divo came to suspect the Droid Gotra was behind the
        programming change in order to give their droid rights movement a
        symbol.
